# Project Introduction

We are excited to introduce BeeSight, our final year project aimed at transforming beekeeping practices in Uganda through innovative technology solutions.

## Project Overview

BeeSight is designed to address critical challenges faced by beekeepers in Uganda:

- Limited access to real-time hive monitoring
- Difficulty in predicting optimal harvest times  
- Lack of data-driven decision support
- Inefficient foraging pattern analysis
- Manual tracking of hive conditions

## Our Solution Approach

We're developing a comprehensive platform that combines:

### 1. Computer Vision Technology
- Automated bee counting at hive entrances
- Activity pattern recognition
- Foraging behavior analysis

### 2. Environmental Monitoring
- Temperature and humidity sensors
- Weather correlation analysis
- Environmental impact assessment

### 3. Machine Learning Analytics
- Predictive modeling for hive productivity
- Pattern recognition for optimal management
- Advisory system for beekeepers

### 4. User-Friendly Interfaces
- Mobile application for field use
- Web dashboard for detailed analytics
- Real-time alert notifications

## Expected Impact

Our solution aims to:
- Increase honey productivity by 20-30%
- Reduce hive management costs
- Improve bee colony health
- Support sustainable beekeeping practices

Stay tuned as we share our development journey, challenges, and breakthroughs!
