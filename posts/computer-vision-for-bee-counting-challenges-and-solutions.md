# Computer Vision Implementation

## The Challenge

Implementing accurate bee counting using computer vision presents unique challenges:

- **Size Variability**: Bees appear in different sizes based on distance
- **Overlapping Objects**: Bees often cluster together
- **Motion Blur**: Fast-moving bees create blurred images
- **Lighting Conditions**: Varying outdoor lighting affects detection
- **Background Complexity**: Natural hive environments are visually complex

## Our Approach

### 1. Data Collection Strategy
We're collecting diverse training data including:
- Different times of day
- Various weather conditions
- Multiple hive types and locations
- Different bee species common in Uganda

### 2. Model Architecture
Using a modified YOLO (You Only Look Once) approach:
```python
# Simplified model structure
class BeeDetector:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = self.load_pretrained_model()
        self.preprocessor = ImagePreprocessor()
    
    def detect_bees(self, image):
        processed_image = self.preprocessor.enhance(image)
        detections = self.model.predict(processed_image)
        return self.post_process(detections)
```

### 3. Preprocessing Pipeline
- **Noise Reduction**: Gaussian blur for noise removal
- **Contrast Enhancement**: Histogram equalization
- **Motion Compensation**: Frame differencing for movement detection

### 4. Tracking Implementation
Implementing multi-object tracking to:
- Count individual bees entering/exiting
- Calculate foraging duration
- Analyze movement patterns

## Performance Metrics

Current achievements:
- **Accuracy**: 89% detection rate in controlled conditions
- **Speed**: 15 FPS on mobile devices
- **Model Size**: 12MB for mobile deployment

## Future Improvements

1. **Data Augmentation**: Synthetic data generation
2. **Transfer Learning**: Leveraging pre-trained models
3. **Edge Optimization**: Further model compression
4. **Real-time Calibration**: Adaptive thresholding

Stay tuned for our testing results and field validation!
