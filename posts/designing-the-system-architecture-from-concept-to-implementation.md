# System Architecture Design

## Overview

After extensive research and planning, we've settled on a microservices architecture for BeeSight that provides scalability, maintainability, and fault tolerance.

## Architectural Layers

### Data Collection Layer
- **IoT Sensors**: Raspberry Pi-based environmental monitoring
- **Computer Vision**: Smartphone camera integration for bee counting
- **Data Validation**: Real-time preprocessing and error detection

### Processing Layer
- **TensorFlow Lite**: On-device machine learning inference
- **Data Pipeline**: Real-time processing and analysis
- **Event Handling**: Asynchronous event-driven updates

### Business Logic Layer
- **Advisory Engine**: Rule-based recommendation system
- **Analytics Engine**: Pattern recognition and trend analysis
- **Alert Management**: Intelligent notification system

### Presentation Layer
- **Flutter Mobile App**: Cross-platform mobile interface
- **React Web Dashboard**: Comprehensive analytics interface
- **Real-time Synchronization**: Offline-first architecture

## Key Design Decisions

### Why Microservices?
1. **Independent Deployment**: Each service can be updated independently
2. **Scalability**: Scale individual components based on demand
3. **Fault Isolation**: One service failure doesn't crash the entire system
4. **Technology Flexibility**: Use the best tool for each job

### Technology Stack Rationale
- **Flutter**: Single codebase for iOS and Android
- **Python/Flask**: Rapid backend development and ML integration
- **PostgreSQL**: Reliable data storage with complex queries
- **Redis**: High-performance caching and session management
- **TensorFlow**: Industry-standard ML framework

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Offline Operation
**Solution**: Implemented local data buffering and sync mechanisms

### Challenge 2: Real-time Processing
**Solution**: Event-driven architecture with WebSocket connections

### Challenge 3: Scalability
**Solution**: Horizontal scaling with load balancing
